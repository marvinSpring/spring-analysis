/**
 * {@link BeanFactory}接口的扩展将由可以枚举其所有bean实例的bean工厂实现，
 * 而不是按照客户端的请求按名称一一尝试进行bean查找。
 * 预加载其所有bean定义的BeanFactory实现（例如基于XML的工厂）可以实现此接口。
 *
 * <p>如果这是{@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}，则返回值<i>不<i>会考虑任何BeanFactory层次结构，
 * 但仅与当前工厂中定义的bean有关。也可以使用{@link BeanFactoryUtils}帮助器类来考虑祖先工厂中的bean。
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesOfType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
